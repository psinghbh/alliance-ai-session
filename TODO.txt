1. The Problem (The Why)
Time: 3min
Key Concept: LLMs are not enough
Talking Points: LLMs are powerful but static (knowledge is limited to training data), they are not agentic (can't perform multi-step tasks or use external tools), and they are API-dependent (vendor lock-in).

2. What is LangChain?
Time: 4
Key Concept: An Orchestration Framework
Talking Points:
Definition: An open-source framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by LLMs. Core Value: It's the "operating system" that connects the brain (LLM) to the hands (Tools/APIs) and the library (Data).

3. The Core Modules (The How)
Time: 5
Key Concept: The Building Blocks
Talking Points:
Introduce the main components that make up any application: Models, Prompts, Chains/LCEL, Retrieval (RAG), and Agents.

4. LangChain in 2025
Time: 3
Key Concept: Evolution and Future
Talking Points:
Highlight the shift: LangChain is moving beyond basic Chains to a more powerful, robust agent building experience using LangGraph (for complex control flow). Mention LangSmith for observability and debugging, which is crucial for production.

TODO: Take these slides and try it in NotebookLM. Create one slide out of it.

i. Prompt Template

ii. Chat Model

6. LangChain Chain
LangChain chain is a workflow that connects multiple components in linked chain together in a sequence.
Where the output of one step becomes the input of the next step.
Each step can be an LLM call, a prompt template, data transformation or tool call, or it can be another chain.

TODO: Need to generate image for this slide
